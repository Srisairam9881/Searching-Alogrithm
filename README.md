## Linear Search 

* a linear search algorithm or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
##

## Algorithm to perform Linear Search
 * 1.Take the input array arr[] from user.
 * 2.Take element(x) you want to search in this array from user.
 * 3.Set flag variable as -1
 * 4.LOOP : arr[start] -> arr[end]
 *     if match found i.e arr[current_postion] == x then
 *      Print “Match Found at position” current_position.
 *      flag = 0
 *      abort
* 5.After loop check flag variable.
*       if flag == -1
*       print “No Match Found”
* 6.STOP
